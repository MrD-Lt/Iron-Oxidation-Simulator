# Iron-Oxidation-Simulator
This repository is dedicated to the development of a software tool to simulate and analyze the oxidation process of Fe(II) in water treatment. The tool aims to provide chemists with key parameters and data for the oxidation process, aiding in the treatment of arsenic-contaminated water.

## Structure:

- `Project/`: This folder contains all the codes and files of this IRP.
- `Development_Log/`: This folder contains logs and other records of the development process of the IRP.

## Getting Started

For those who are familiar with codes:
1. Navigate to `Iron-Oxidation-Simulator/Project/IronOxidationSimulator/src`
2. 

For those who just want to use the software (GUI):
1. Navigate to `Iron-Oxidation-Simulator/Project/SoftWare`
2.
